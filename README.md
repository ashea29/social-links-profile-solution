## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Screenshot
As an added challenge, I decided to create a theme toggle for this project. I added a separate set of color variables closely related to those for the default theme, and a button to switch between themes:

**Light Theme**

**Dark Theme**

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass mixins
- Custom script to check accessibility (using [pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y))

### What I learned
In this challenge, I was able to get some more practice (always a good thing!) writing semantic HTML, as well as using the BEM naming convention for CSS classes.

Additionally, I was able to solidify a strategy I intend to use, going forward, for creating a maintainable light-theme/dark-theme toggle.
